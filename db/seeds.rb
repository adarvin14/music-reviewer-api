# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Album.create(title: "title 1", artist: "artist 1", release_year: "2020" )
# Review.create(album_id: 1, content: "content 1" )
# Review.create(artist: "artist 2", album: "album 2", content: "content 2")
# Review.create(artist: "artist 3", album: "album 3", content: "content 3")
# Review.create(artist: "artist 4", album: "album 4", content: "content 4")
